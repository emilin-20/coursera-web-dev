        <div class="para" >Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and 
            boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes 
            cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated 
            fat

        <p>
        <div class="para">Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to
            varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most
            hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red 
            meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and
            coronary heart disease, especially when processed.

            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown
            rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, 
            yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is 
            often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.
